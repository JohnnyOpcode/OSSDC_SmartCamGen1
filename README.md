# OSSDC_SmartCamGen1
First Generation Smart Camera for OSSDC.org

Based on the ZynqBerry 7010 from Trenz Electronics (Germany) and standard Raspberry PI Camera(s) we are moving as much computation for SDC to the sensor. We believe this will be a future trend anyways so why not start now (thank-you TARDIS).

You can get a free Xilinx Webpack to work and explore this project.

Enjoy, participate, learn new things. A better world awaits.
